# My Personal Portfolio

Bold visuals, smooth interactions, and a light/dark theme toggle that follows system preference.

## Structure
- `index.html` — main page layout and content
- `style.css` — global styles, layout, typography, animations
- `script.js` — navigation behavior, theme handling, IntersectionObserver logic, canvas effects
- `my_CV.pdf` — downloadable resume

## Notes
- External links open in a new tab with `noopener` for safety.
- Reduced-motion preference slows the canvas animations instead of disabling them.
